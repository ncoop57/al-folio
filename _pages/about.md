Hi there, my name is Nathan Cooper. I am currently a Ph.D. student at [William and Mary](https://www.wm.edu/) under the mentorship of [Dr. Denys Poshyvanyk](http://www.cs.wm.edu/~denys/). My research interests are at the intersection of Software Engineering and Machine Learning. I hope to contribute to educating the world by helping creating the next generation of education tools such as the [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) and the [edX](https://www.edx.org/) platform that democratizes knowledge and education. It is my belief that personalized learning will be the future of education and I hope to contribute to that vision.

As a hobby, I work on personal projects which you can find a list of, hopefully mostly complete, ones on my Projects page. Below you will find my resume if you are curious in any of my other experiences or accomplishments.
