Hi there, my name is Nathan. I am currently the Lead Research Scientist for the [Code.AI](code.ai) and Language Team at [Stability AI](stability.ai). My research focuses on large language models for conversational artificial intelligence and for helping software developers by applying Deep Learning to Software Engineering problems such as code generation and bug fixing. I received my Ph.D. from the College of [William and Mary](https://www.wm.edu/) in Computer Science in 2023 under the awesome advisement of [Dr. Denys Poshyvanyk](http://www.cs.wm.edu/~denys/). 


Feel free to peruse my website here for my publications, blog posts on fun projects I've done, or professional and personal projects I've worked on. You can also checkout my resume [here](https://nathancooper.io). If you have any questions or just want to say hi, feel free to connect via email at nathanacoop@gmail.com, Twitter @ncooper57, or LinkedIn!
<!-- As a hobby, I work on personal projects which you can find a list of, hopefully mostly complete, ones on my Projects page. -->

<!-- Hi there, my name is Nathan Cooper. I am currently a Ph.D. student at [William and Mary](https://www.wm.edu/) under the mentorship of [Dr. Denys Poshyvanyk](http://www.cs.wm.edu/~denys/). My research interests are at the intersection of Software Engineering and Machine Learning. I hope to contribute to educating the world by helping creating the next generation of education tools such as the [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) and the [edX](https://www.edx.org/) platform that democratizes knowledge and education. It is my belief that personalized learning will be the future of education and I hope to contribute to that vision. -->
